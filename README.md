# URL Categorise
A tool which makes use of a set of domain host lists, and is then able to classify a given URL.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'url_categorise'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install UrlCategorise

## Usage
The default host lists I picked for their separated categories.
I didn't select them for the quality of data
Use at your own risk!

```ruby
  require 'url_categorise'
  client = UrlCategorise::Client.new

  client.count_of_hosts
  client.count_of_categories
  client.size_of_data # In megabytes

  url = "www.google.com"
  client.categorise(url)

  # Can also initialise the client using a custom dataset
  host_urls = {
    abuse: ["https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists/raw/master/abuse.txt"]
  }

  require 'url_categorise'
  client = UrlCategorise::Client.new(host_urls: host_urls)

  # You can also define symbols to combine other categories
  host_urls = {
    abuse: ["https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists/raw/master/abuse.txt"],
    bad_links: [:abuse]
  }

  require 'url_categorise'
  client = UrlCategorise::Client.new(host_urls: host_urls)
```
